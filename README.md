## 👨‍💻 About Me

<img align="right" alt="AI & Robotics" width="380" style="margin-left: 20px;" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNnQ4azRjeWI3dmYyM3JoNGhqNHB3cmJibHNpczA2M3d4NHFrajliMiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/f4ztZcdm9Fi90vL4Zd/giphy.gif">

I build the 'brains' of intelligent machines. My goal is to become a **systems software engineer** specializing in **embedded systems**, **operating systems (OS/RTOS)**, and **performance optimization** for edge devices like **NVIDIA Jetson**.

I'm currently a Independent Researcher at PyBrain, developing a robot that grasps objects using natural language commands through VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models. Working with these heavy AI models on resource-constrained hardware exposed me to critical **latency and efficiency challenges**—problems that can't be solved at the application level alone.

I'm actively seeking internship opportunities in systems software or embedded engineering for 2027.

## 🔥 Core Focus: The Robot Brain Stack

### 🧠 Operating Systems & RTOS
System performance starts at the OS level. I'm preparing to specialize in OS design that efficiently manages AI computational resources and ensures real-time reliability for robotics applications. This includes Linux kernel optimization, RTOS implementation, and scheduler tuning—the foundation that will enable everything else.

### ⚙️ Hardware-Software Co-Design (CODES)
Great software needs deep hardware understanding. I approach system optimization through CODES—designing software (OS) and hardware (like Jetson) to work together as one integrated system, not separate components.

### 🚀 AI Models & Deployment
I'm currently deploying VLA models and reinforcement learning in production robotics. This hands-on experience with real performance bottlenecks motivates my focus on Real-Time ROS and CODES—because that's where the solutions lie.

## 🌱 Future Direction

I'm building deep technical expertise in systems software for autonomous applications. My path includes:

**Near-term (2026-2027)**: MSCS program focusing on operating systems, embedded systems, and real-time computing. Securing internships in systems software or embedded engineering.

**Long-term**: Contributing to next-generation operating systems for autonomous agents and establishing best practices for deploying AI on resource-constrained hardware. Building ventures on strong technical foundations that solve real problems.

## 💭 My Approach

I see parallels across biological intelligence, system design, and AI:

- **System-level thinking**: OS efficiency matters as much as raw computational power
- **Hardware awareness**: Software must be designed with hardware constraints in mind
- **Real-world deployment**: Models are valuable only when they run reliably in production
- **Interdisciplinary mindset**: Best solutions come from understanding multiple layers of the stack

This perspective guides my work in creating autonomous systems that are intelligent, reliable, and practical.
