## üî• Areas of Interest

My research and career interests center on the intersection of AI intelligence and practical implementation through:

### MLOps & System Architecture
I focus on building robust systems that enable AI to operate reliably at scale. This infrastructure is critical for transitioning models from research to production environments.

### Reinforcement Learning
I believe reinforcement learning represents fundamental intelligence principles through reward-based mechanisms - a pattern that appears throughout nature and human cognition.

### Operating Systems for AI
Just as human brains need efficient "operating systems" to manage cognitive resources, AI systems require specialized architectures for optimal performance and resource allocation.

### Robotics & Physical AI
The integration of perception, decision-making, and physical action creates uniquely challenging problems that represent the next frontier in intelligent systems.

## üå± Future Goals

My career path focuses on developing deep technical expertise in AI systems. After pursuing advanced education in MLOps, reinforcement learning, and robotics systems, I aim to grow within innovative organizations where I can contribute to cutting-edge AI development while continuously expanding my skills.

## üí≠ My Philosophy on Intelligence and Systems

I see strong parallels between biological intelligence, reinforcement learning, and blockchain governance:

- Intelligent systems fundamentally operate on reward mechanisms
- Robust systems have aligned incentives where individual and collective benefits harmonize
- Operating system efficiency is as important as raw computational power
- True intelligence emerges from the interaction between reward-seeking, continuous learning, and environmental feedback

This unified view informs my approach to both technical development and organizational design.
