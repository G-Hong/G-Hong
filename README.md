## üî• Areas of Interest

My research and career interests center on the intersection of AI intelligence and practical implementation through:

### MLOps & System Architecture
Building robust systems that enable AI to operate reliably at scale is critical for real-world applications. I'm fascinated by the infrastructure that allows models to function in production environments.

### Reinforcement Learning
I believe reinforcement learning represents the fundamental principles of intelligence through reward-based mechanisms. The way systems learn to maximize rewards mirrors core learning patterns across nature.

### Operating Systems for AI
How we organize computational resources fundamentally affects AI capability. Just as the human brain needs efficient "operating systems" to manage cognitive resources, AI systems need specialized architectures.

### Robotics & Physical AI
Intelligent systems that can interact with the physical world represent the next frontier. The integration of perception, decision-making, and physical action creates uniquely challenging problems.

### Why These Areas?
These fields together represent the complete stack needed for truly intelligent autonomous systems. From the theoretical foundations of learning to practical implementation in physical systems, each component plays a critical role in advancing useful AI.

## üå± Future Goals

My career path focuses on developing deep technical expertise in AI systems. After pursuing advanced education in MLOps, reinforcement learning, and robotics systems, I aim to grow within innovative organizations where I can contribute to cutting-edge AI development while continuously expanding my skills.

I believe AI's future lies in creating systems that augment human capabilities and generate sustainable value. My long-term goal is to help develop AI architectures that combine robust operational reliability with intelligent decision-making, whether as part of an established organization or eventually applying this expertise to solve meaningful problems through new ventures.

## üí≠ My Philosophy on Intelligence and Systems

I see strong parallels between biological intelligence, reinforcement learning, and blockchain governance:

- Intelligent systems fundamentally operate on reward mechanisms
- Robust systems have aligned incentives where individual and collective benefits harmonize
- Operating system efficiency is as important as raw computational power
- True intelligence emerges from the interaction between reward-seeking, continuous learning, and environmental feedback

This unified view informs my approach to both technical development and organizational design.
