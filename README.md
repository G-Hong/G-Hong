## 👨‍💻 About Me

<img align="right" alt="AI & Robotics" width="380" style="margin-left: 20px;" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNnQ4azRjeWI3dmYyM3JoNGhqNHB3cmJibHNpczA2M3d4NHFrajliMiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/f4ztZcdm9Fi90vL4Zd/giphy.gif">

I design and build **robust, scalable systems** that bring AI models from research labs into real-world interactions. My interdisciplinary journey from chemistry to cryptography to AI has revealed how fundamental principles like reward-based learning span across domains. This insight drives my focus on creating systems that don't just work—they're **reliable, scalable, and truly intelligent**.

Through entrepreneurial projects like 'PuriPuri' (AI education), I've developed execution skills that turn ideas into reality. My research on 'PCV' demonstrated analytical capabilities in mathematically proving system reliability. My goal is to combine these strengths as an engineer who bridges **theoretical depth with practical implementation** to shape the future of **autonomous systems**.

## 🔥 Core Focus: AI Systems for Robotics

My research centers on building the complete technology stack needed for intelligent autonomous systems, approached through three key layers:

### **LAYER 1: Foundation**
#### 🤖 AI Systems & Operating Systems
System performance is determined by its underlying OS and architecture. I focus on next-generation OS design that efficiently manages AI computational resources and ensures real-time reliability for robotics applications.

### **LAYER 2: Scalability**
#### 🚀 MLOps & System Architecture  
Even brilliant models are worthless without stable deployment and management. I specialize in MLOps pipelines and robust architectures that deploy, monitor, and update AI models across large robot fleets.

### **LAYER 3: Intelligence**
#### 🧠 Reinforcement Learning
RL explores intelligence through reward mechanisms—the most fundamental approach to learning. I research algorithms that enable robots to learn optimal behaviors through physical world interactions.

This layered approach allows me to tackle robotics challenges with a **holistic perspective** spanning from hardware-level systems to real applications.

## 🌱 Future Goals

I focus on developing deep technical expertise in AI systems for autonomous applications. After pursuing advanced education in MLOps, reinforcement learning, and robotics systems, I aim to contribute to **next-generation operating systems for autonomous agents** and establish **best practices for MLOps in robotics**.

My long-term goal is leading development of AI architectures that combine robust operational reliability with intelligent decision-making, solving meaningful problems through ventures built on strong technical foundations.

## 💭 Philosophy on Intelligence & Systems

I see strong parallels between biological intelligence, reinforcement learning, and system design:

- **Operating system efficiency** is as important as raw computational power
- **Robust systems** align individual and collective benefits harmoniously  
- **Intelligent systems** fundamentally operate through reward mechanisms
- **True intelligence** emerges from reward-seeking, continuous learning, and environmental feedback

This unified view guides my approach to creating autonomous systems that are intelligent, reliable, and scalable.
